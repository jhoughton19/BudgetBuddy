## Slide 1: Problem

### Budget Book Creation Is Painful
**What Your Auditor Faces Every Year:**

- **80-120 hours** of manual work
- Exporting data from Munis/Caselle
- Copy-pasting into Excel templates
- Checking formulas for errors
- Writing narrative descriptions
- Formatting for GFOA compliance
- Praying nothing breaks before printing

**Result:** Stressed staff, late nights, delayed budgets

## Slide 2: Impact on Small Counties

### The Cost of Manual Budget Prep

**Time:**
- 2-3 weeks of finance dept capacity
- Delays strategic planning

**Quality:**

- Inconsistent formatting year-to-year
- Generic narratives (copy-paste from last year)
