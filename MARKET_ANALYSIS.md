## Why Target Small Counties?

### Pain Points (Validated Through Research)

**Limited Staff:**
- Average finance dept: 2-3 people
- Auditor often wears multiple hats (HR, IT, compliance)
- No dedicated budget analyst
- High turnover in small counties

**Time Constraints:**
- Budget book creation: 60-120 hours annually
- Manual data entry from financial system
- Excel formula errors common
- Narrative writing takes 20+ hours

**Compliance Pressure:**
- Utah State Auditor annual reviews
- GFOA Certificate of Achievement requirements
- Increasing transparency demands (open data portals)
- Limited training budgets

**Technology Gap:**
- Still using basic Excel templates
- Munis/Caselle underutilized (just data entry)
- No analytics capabilities
- Manual variance analysis

### Budget Reality

**Annual Finance Department Budgets:**
- 3rd class: $250k-500k
- 4th class: $150k-300k
- 5th class: $100k-200k
- 6th class: $75k-150k

**BudgetBuddy at $3k-5k = 2-3% of budget**
**But saves 100+ hours = 15-20% of staff time**

**ROI: 5-10x in first year**
